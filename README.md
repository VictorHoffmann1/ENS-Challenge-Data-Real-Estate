# ENS-Challenge-Data-Real-Estate

## Summary:
This challenge organized by ENS Ulm and Coll√®ge de France was about predicting real estate prices with tabular data and images.
One of the main the difficulties of this challenge was that we had two types of data: tabular data and images. Moreover, each real estate good contained between 1 and 6 images, which all had different sizes. Therefore, a lot of efforts into data importation had to be put. I decided to make a concatenation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the tabular data and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the images using Keras. 

My rank on the public leaderboard is 8th out of the 167 participants. You can find the leaderboard here: https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/68/ranking/public
