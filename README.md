# ENS-Challenge-Data-Real-Estate
This challenge organized by ENS Ulm and Coll√®ge de France was about predicting real estate prices with tabular data and images.
One of the main the difficulties of this challenge was that we had two types of data: tabular data and images. Moreover, each real estate good contained between 1 and 6 images, which all had different sizes. Therefore, a lot of efforts in terms of data importation had to be made. 

I made a concatenation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the tabular data and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the images. 

You can find the code that I've written (jupyter notebook) in this repository.
